Habit 3: Don't reinvent the wheel.

Google before defining our own function. 

It is very likely that we have the same or similar one in a Python package.

For example:

pandas has great functions to deal with time stamp, like to_datetime(), Timedelta(), etc.

We can let them take care of the time stamp format, instead of defining our own functions to deal with the string values.
