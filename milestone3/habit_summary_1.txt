Habit 1: Print some values in a long loop.

It often takes some time to go over the entire dataset. To get a sense of how fast your program is running, you can print some values once in a while. 

For example:


for i in range(1000000):
  do something here
  if i % 100000 == 0:
     print(i / 1000000, 'is finished')
