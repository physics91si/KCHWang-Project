In ride-sharing business, we care a lot about allocating drivers to different areas based on the demand of riders. Supply-demand forecasting is critical and challenging for Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing company in China. We would like to perform machine learning method to predict supply and demand based on their dataset.We have order information from a City M in China. The dataset covers every order happened in January 2016. There are about one million orders per day in the city. For each order, we have features including driver_id, passenger_id, start_district_hash, dest_district_hash, price and time. Auxiliary information includes traffic and weather condition. Since the districts are given by hash values, we also have attributes like the number of different facilities in one district. We want to train our model on the first 3 to 4 weeksâ€™ data, and test on the last 1 to 2 weeks. Detailed description of data can be found on http://research.xiaojukeji.com/competition/detail.action?competitionId=DiTech2016.We will start with labeling number of supply and demand based on the order information, which would be the output of our program. Linear regression can be a base line model.
